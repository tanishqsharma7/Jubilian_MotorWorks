                The all-new Volvo XC60 is a terrific luxury compact SUV.
                It&apos;s been fully redesigned for 2017 and features
                improvements across the board. These changes bump the vehicle
                from its previous midpack standing; it now resides with some of
                the best in the class. Some of the most notable improvements
                include a state-of-the-art infotainment system, more legroom for
                rear-seat riders, and peppy engine choices.
